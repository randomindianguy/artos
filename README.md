A basic design for the landing page. 
Only HTML/CSS was used to design this. I'll have to design the rest of the pages, ie the "Features" and the "Contact" pages. 

Also I wanted to do a features page that showed the different features of the app, mainly that it's privacy focussed, tracks net worth, gives market insights etc.  I'm not entirely sure of how to do that just yet. But I'll try figuring it out. 

One other thing I came up with was the typing animation. It works properly when set to infinite time. When it's a finite time, it works once, but then it goes to blank. I know why it does so, but I'm not sure how to work around this. I'll look it up soon!
